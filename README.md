Learning exp-

This project was a great learning experience as it involved multiple programming languages. I mainly worked with C and only had basic knowledge of C++, so switching between languages—especially Bash—was a bit challenging. I used AI tools to help convert some C code into Bash scripts, which made things easier and helped me understand how the same logic works in different languages. At the end, i understood that i'll have to focus more on understanding things and basics of other languages as well

Challenges-

The same thing again, involvement of multiple programming languages was kinda harsh and tough to deal with the questions.

For question1-
I created a directory and then log 3 different new files, I renamed the first file as missionlogtext, then displayed the lines with error. And then counted the number of lines using wc -l mission_log.txt
 and showed the date and time using date used # sudo shutdown +10 for shutdown in 10 mins.

 For question2-
 Wrote the condition for the battery limit, i.e less than 20 then return to base. and then ping google to check the connectivity. if 0 then print communication failure. At the end of loop if both conditions are successful then print all sys are operational.

 For question 5-
 Had errors but here's my idea. using decode function where if the characters are lowercase then we first apply the condition given in the question and then capitalize them.
